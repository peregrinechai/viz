### I know this is not nice, but wait till I finish the course


```{r}
readRDS("del1Draft.rds")
```



### I am doing my best but still much to learn

```{r}
readRDS("del2Draft.rds")
```


### This might be the worst scatter plot, but...

```{r}
readRDS("del3Draft.rds")
```

### Making this map was easy, but still hard to understand

```{r}
readRDS("del4Draft.rds")
```
